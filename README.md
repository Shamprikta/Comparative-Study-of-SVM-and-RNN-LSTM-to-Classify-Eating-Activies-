-- The project shows a comparative study between SVM and RNN-LSTM in terms of classifying the eating activities based on mastication sounds.

-- Mastication sounds are sounds related to jaw movements (eg: eating, drinking, talking, chewing).

-- Why do we classify these sounds? Some health issues like Obesity has been linked by the mastication counts, which in effect causes lot other serious health conditions. So by keeping the counts of mastication, eating habits can be monitored.

-- This project includes the following: 

• Audio Features

• Balancing Imbalanced dataset

• LSTM for classifying eating activities 

• SVM for classifying eating activities 

• Hyperparameter Optimization

-- Please refer to report for detailed explanation of the project.

-- If you have any further questions related to feature extraction, data processing, or the project in general feel free to ask
